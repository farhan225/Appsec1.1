Bug Write Up for Part 2

crash1.gft

Changed the value of examplegc.num_bytes to -1 from 116 in giftcardexamplewirter.c 
Generated crash1.gft file using giftcardexamplewirter.c 
Used GDB to step through program to identify the fucntion where code crashed: gdb --args ./gift 1 crash1.gft
the program crashed in line fread(&ret_val->num_bytes, 4,1, input_fd);
180		while (!feof(input_fd)) {
(gdb) 
Thread 2 received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007fff2039d0e0 in ?? ()

Bug: 

The crash.gft file making a request that is too large and the space cannot be allocated and a null pointer is returned.
The negative valeu (-1) passed via num_bytes is converted to an ungsigned value of type size_it which leads to a huge
positive value.

Fix: 
Added a check in giftcardreader.c program to validate the value of num_bytes.

        if (ret_val->num_bytes < 0) {

        printf (" Negative value exiting \n");
        exit(0);
